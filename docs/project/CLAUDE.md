## Development Instructions
1. Follow phase files step-by-step in sequence (Phase0 ‚Üí Phase1 ‚Üí Phase2 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Phase10)
2. Mark checkboxes `- [ ]` as `- [x]` when steps are completed
3. Update status indicators: ‚è≥ Pending ‚Üí üîÑ In Progress ‚Üí ‚úÖ Completed
4. Update ProjectProgress.md when phases are completed
5. Document AI usage (Q Developer/Kiro) for hackathon evidence
6. Commit with proper tags showing AI-generated content

## Project Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 32.5 hours across 11 phases
- **Total Steps**: 88 trackable development steps
- **Target**: 2-day hackathon timeline
- **Current Status**: Ready to begin Phase 0 setup

## Development Rules
- **ALWAYS** read the phase file before starting work on that phase
- **ALWAYS** update progress checkboxes as you complete steps
- **ALWAYS** capture evidence of AI-assisted development
- For each phase, mark it as in_progress when starting, completed when finished
- For some functions if you think it can done by manually configure in the AWS console by me. Please guide me to do it. Seems like this will be more effective in order to make the project done
