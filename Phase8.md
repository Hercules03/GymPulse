        'status': raw_data['status'],  # occupied/free only
        'timestamp': round_timestamp(raw_data['timestamp']),  # Round to nearest minute
        'gymId': raw_data['gymId'],  # Branch identifier only
        'category': raw_data['category']  # Equipment category only
    }
    
    # Explicitly exclude any other fields
    return anonymized
```

### 3.2 Consent Management
- [x] **File**: `frontend/src/components/privacy/PrivacyNotice.tsx` - âœ… Consent flow implemented

- [x] Easy withdrawal of consent via decline button
- [x] Consent logging and audit trail capability
- [x] Age verification disclaimer with Hong Kong context

### 3.3 PDPO Compliance Documentation
```markdown
# Privacy Data Protection Ordinance (PDPO) Compliance

## Data Collection
- Machine occupancy status (non-personal)
- Session-based geolocation (with consent, not stored)
- No personal identifiers or behavioral tracking

## User Rights
- Access: Users can request data deletion
- Correction: No personal data stored to correct
- Erasure: Immediate deletion of location data on session end
- Portability: Occupancy data available via API

## Legal Basis
- Legitimate interest for gym availability service
- Explicit consent for location-based features
