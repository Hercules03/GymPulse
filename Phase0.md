---

## Step 4: CDK Starter Stack Generation
**Duration**: 25 minutes  
**Status**: âœ… Completed

### 4.1 Generate CDK Foundation
- [x] **Prompt AI**: "Generate CDK starter stack with placeholders for IoT Core, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Bedrock agent, and Location Service"
- [x] Create base CDK app structure
- [x] Add placeholder constructs for all AWS services
- [x] Include proper TypeScript types and imports

### 4.2 Infrastructure Planning
- [x] Document planned AWS resources
- [x] Create resource naming conventions
- [x] Plan IAM roles and policies structure

---

## Step 5: Evidence Capture System
**Duration**: 20 minutes  
**Status**: âœ… Completed

### 5.1 Set Up Recording Workflow
- [x] Create screenshots directory for AI interactions
- [x] Set up commit message templates with AI attribution
- [x] Configure PR templates with AI evidence sections
- [x] Create evidence tracking checklist

### 5.2 Documentation Templates
