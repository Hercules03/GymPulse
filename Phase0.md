**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

### 3.1 Architecture README
- [x] **Prompt AI**: "Create high-level architecture README for GymPulse IoT gym availability system"
- [x] Document system components and data flow
- [x] Include AWS services architecture diagram
- [x] Add technology stack overview

### 3.2 Project Documentation
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- [ ] Set up issue templates for GitHub
- [x] Document AI assistance workflow

---

## Step 4: CDK Starter Stack Generation
**Duration**: 25 minutes  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

### 4.1 Generate CDK Foundation
- [x] **Prompt AI**: "Generate CDK starter stack with placeholders for IoT Core, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Bedrock agent, and Location Service"
- [x] Create base CDK app structure
- [x] Add placeholder constructs for all AWS services
- [x] Include proper TypeScript types and imports

### 4.2 Infrastructure Planning
- [x] Document planned AWS resources
- [x] Create resource naming conventions
- [x] Plan IAM roles and policies structure

---

## Step 5: Evidence Capture System
**Duration**: 20 minutes  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### 5.1 Set Up Recording Workflow
- [ ] Create screenshots directory for AI interactions
- [ ] Set up commit message templates with AI attribution
- [ ] Configure PR templates with AI evidence sections
- [ ] Create evidence tracking checklist

### 5.2 Documentation Templates
- [ ] Create templates for AI-generated code documentation
- [ ] Set up change log format for AI contributions
- [ ] Plan hackathon submission evidence structure

---

## Step 6: Development Environment Setup
**Duration**: 25 minutes  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### 6.1 Node.js and CDK Setup
- [ ] Install Node.js 18+ and npm
- [ ] Install AWS CDK CLI globally
- [ ] Configure AWS CLI with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Verify CDK bootstrap capability

### 6.2 Python Environment
- [ ] Install Python 3.9+ for Lambda functions
- [ ] Set up virtual environment for Lambda development
- [ ] Install boto3 and AWS Lambda Python libraries

### 6.3 Development Tools
- [ ] Install VS Code with AWS extensions
- [ ] Configure linting and formatting tools
- [ ] Set up debugging configuration

---

## Step 7: Initial Commit and Evidence
**Duration**: 15 minutes  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### 7.1 First Commit
- [ ] Stage all initial files and structure
- [ ] Create comprehensive first commit message
- [ ] Tag commit as AI-assisted setup

### 7.2 Evidence Documentation
- [ ] Screenshot AI assistant setup process
- [ ] Document initial code generation sessions
- [ ] Create baseline for hackathon evidence

### 7.3 Git Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Phase 0 repository and AI assistant setup

- Mono-repo structure with /infra, /backend, /frontend, /agent, /simulator
- High-level architecture README and documentation
